## Level 1
- You're given a list of values of object property.
    Example: The object is a tree.
    Length:[ Short, medium, tall]
    Leaf colour: [Green, yellow, red]
    Like this, you have multiple properties.

    Now create a list of random objects by randomly selecting each property's value.
## Level 2
- Generate unique objects in part 1. Unique = all elements combined are not the same.

## Level 3
- Add a 'rarity' option for any element in any list in the input. Then that element should occur rarely in result arrays.
    For example, if the 'Tall' property is 'rare' then there should be only a few tall trees when you create random trees in part 2.
